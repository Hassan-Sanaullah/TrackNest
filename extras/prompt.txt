I'm building a backend-only real-time analytics platform called MetricPulse using NestJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis, and WebSockets. The goal is to let users track website traffic (page views, clicks, etc.) in real time and view historical summaries.

Features include:

    JWT-based authentication for users

    An event ingestion API (/track) that stores raw event data

    PostgreSQL for event, website, user, and summary storage

    CRON jobs to aggregate event data into hourly/daily summaries

    WebSocket gateway to push real-time analytics to connected dashboards

    Redis for caching, pub/sub for real-time, and optional rate-limiting

The architecture is modular and scalable, with proper separation of concerns (auth, events, websites, stats, etc.).

When I ask questions using this prompt, assume I'm referring to this MetricPulse backend project unless I say otherwise.
